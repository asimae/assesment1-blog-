            <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>Cosmetics are composed of mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources or synthetically created ones.Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body and skin. Cosmetics designed to enhance or alter one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes), add color to a person's face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object.Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.
            Types
Though there are a large number of different cosmetics used for a variety of different purposes, all cosmetics are typically intended to be applied externally. These products can be applied to the face (on the skin, lips, eyebrows, and eyes), to the body (on the skin, in particular the hands and nails), and to the hair. These products may be intended for use as skincare, personal care or to alter the appearance, with the subset of cosmetics known as makeup primarily referring to products containing colour pigments intended for the purpose of altering the wearer's appearance; some manufacturers will distinguish only between "decorative" cosmetics intended to alter the appearance and "care" cosmetics designed for skincare and personal care.

Most cosmetics are also distinguished by the area of the body intended for application, with cosmetics designed to be used on the face and eye area usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips. Cosmetics can also be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream emulsions, powders (pressed or loose), dispersions, or anhydrous creams or sticks.All cosmetic preparation has their application for long or short periods to
beautify the body as well as to keep the body healthy up to some extent and
has psychological impact to other. The “active life” of any cosmetic preparation
begins the moment it is brought in contact with the skin/hair/teeth/or nails and
ends when it is removed or has evaporated. During it is active life; it has
intimate reciprocal relationship, which results, cosmetic changes on the body.
The cosmetic product prevents its outmost layer from drying out, penetrate
below the external layer and introduce active substances in to deep lying strata
or adhere only superficially to change color or luster of areas. The cosmetic
which are used for decorative purposes, i.e., eye lines, rouges, mascara, face
masking preparations etc and also carries the inherent risk of desirable side
effects. It may inhibit important physiological process, chemically modify
certain skin constituents (e.g., in case of bleaching and coloring preparations),
and contribute towards their removal or even give rise to certain allergic
reactions.
